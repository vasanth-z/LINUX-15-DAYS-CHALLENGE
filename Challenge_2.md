# ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 2: File Creation, Copying & Moving

## ðŸ§  Objective

Practice fundamental file manipulation commands:  
- Creating empty files  
- Copying files to different locations with renaming  
- Moving files within the directory structure  

---

## ðŸªœ Steps

### âœ… Step 1: Create an Empty File

Navigate to the `~/projects/my_project/src` directory (created in challenge 1) and create an empty file named `main.c`.

```bash
cd ~/projects/my_project/src
touch main.c
```

#### Directory Contents After File Creation (After Step 1):

Show the contents of the src directory to confirm main.c was created.

Command:

```bash
ls -l ~/projects/my_project/src/
```

###  âœ… Step 2: Copy and Rename a File

Copy the main.c file from `~/projects/my_project/src` to `~/projects/my_project/docs.`

```bash
cp ~/projects/my_project/src/main.c ~/projects/my_project/docs/mydocs.c
```

#### Directory Contents After Copying (After Step 2):

Show the contents of the docs directory to confirm mydocs.c was copied there.

Show the contents of the src directory again to confirm main.c is still there.

Commands:

```bash
ls -l ~/projects/my_project/docs/
ls -l ~/projects/my_project/src/
```

###  âœ… Step 3: Move a File (Upwards)

Move the file from `~/projects/my_project/docs` to `~/projects/my_project (one level up from docs)`.

```bash
mv ~/projects/my_project/docs/README.md ~/projects/my_project/
```

#### Directory Contents After Moving (After Step 3):

Show the contents of the my_project directory to confirm mydocs.c is now there.

Show the contents of the docs directory to confirm mydocs.c is no longer there.

Commands:

```bash
ls -l ~/projects/my_project/
ls -l ~/projects/my_project/docs/
```
