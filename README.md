## 🎯 Project Goals

My commitment for the next 15 days is to:

- ✅ **Master Linux**: Progress from basic commands to advanced system administration techniques.
- ✅ **Execute Real-World POCs**: Tackle unique, practical challenges inspired by actual Linux scenarios.
- ✅ **Document Everything**: Meticulously record each day's work, including detailed explanations, functional scripts, and clear command outputs.
- ✅ **Build a Strong Portfolio**: Create a tangible collection of work to showcase my capabilities for interviews and professional development.
- ✅ **Share My Progress**: Transparently post daily updates and insights on GitHub and LinkedIn.
